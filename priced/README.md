# [Priced](https://codedesign.dev/challenge/priced)

The Priced page is a key element of a cloud storage website, as it is where users can learn about the different pricing plans and options available to them. The page features a clean and modern design, with a headline under the nav component and three pricing cards with features checklist and CTA on each. The pricing cards clearly and concisely describe the different plans and their features, making it easy for users to compare and contrast the options. The pricing page is an important part of the user journey, as it helps users understand the costs and benefits of using the cloud storage service, and helps them make informed decisions about which plan is best for them.
